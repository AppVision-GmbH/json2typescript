# json2typescript

**json2typescript** is a small package containing a helper class that maps json objects to an instance of a TypeScript class. The idea is that we only need a simple function call in order to fill a json string into nested objects in TypeScript.

---

## Dependencies

We developed **json2typescript** for Angular2. In this document, we only cover this use case. However, you may use our package for pure TypeScript or even JavaScript applications.

---

## Setup a Test Application

We recommend to use the official **angular-cli** tool in order to set up a new Angular project. Then, all you need to do is type the following into your operating system's terminal:

```sh
ng new testApplication
cd testApplication
npm install json2typescript
```
Now you are ready to use the package.
